<h2 class="section-heading">WCAG 2.0 on Color Contrast - Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.</h2>


A Good Friend of me gave me a good Tip yesterday about the Failure in White Font Colors on Ratio Contrast. There are some Colors which give you a failure output, but the strange thing is, the most web dev don't know it about. You can read here some Introductions and Details about the right Color Contrast Ration Effect. Go See [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/) Awesome Doc about Ratio: 
[WCAG 2.0 on Color Contrast - Ratio](http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/)

There is a nice Docs too on W3 [W3.org Docs - WCAG 2.0 on Color Contrast - Ratio](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#visual-audio-contrast)

<blockquote>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

- Steve Jobs
